# How to Set Up a Chess Board

Chess is a game unlike most others. As a result, if you have never played chess before, setting up a chess board can be a little tricky. But don't worry - once you get the hang of where all the pieces go, you will be able to do it with your eyes closed!

## Materials

Each player has 16 chess pieces. These are the pieces used to play chess:

* 8 pawns
* 2 bishops
* 2 knights
* 2 rooks
* 1 queen
* 1 king

## Setting it Up

There is no specific order in which you must set your pieces up. This is just the easiest way to do it, in my opinion.

1. Between you and your opponent, pick the set of pieces you want between the two colors.
2. In the second row which is closest to you, set up your pawns (one in each square).
3. In the row closest to you (the first row), start by setting up your rooks. The two rooks go on the two outermost squares of the row.
4. In that same row, set up the knights. Each knight goes next to each rook.
5. Next, set up the bishops. Each bishop goes next to each knight.
6. Now, as you can see, there are only two spots. Put the queen in one of those spots (it does not matter which).
7. Lastly, put the king in the last spot left.


Your side of the board is now set up, and you are ready to play. Good luck!
